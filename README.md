## A few steps to follow(One time process):

Open your Chrome browser with a default profile where the Gmail linked to your ERP is logged in and is set to default.

If not then change the link in the get_otp() below.

1. Open the default Chrome profile and type `chrome://version/`
Copy Executable Path and Profile Path

e.g. Executable Path: `C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe`

Profile Path: `C:\Users\Dnyandeep\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default`

2. Go to the end of the Class ERPLogin and enter your ERP details viz. user_id, password, fathers_name, mothers_name, and birthplace.

#### AND IT'S DONE!!
